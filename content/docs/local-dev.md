# Local Development

Wave utilizes the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/vite" target="_blank">Laravel Vite plugin</a> for compiling assets and enabling hot-reloading. Let's set it up below.

## Install Node Dependencies

From your project folder, run the following command:

<include src="docs/filename-top.html"></include><include src="docs/file-buttons.html" file="none"></include>
```bash
npm install
```
</div>

This will install many dependencies including <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">Tailwind</a>, <a href="https://alpinejs.dev" target="_blank">Alpine</a>, and <a href="https://vite.dev" target="_blank">Vite</a>.

## Start your Asset Watcher

After you've installed the node dependencies, you'll then need to run:

<include src="docs/filename-top.html"></include><include src="docs/file-buttons.html" file="none"></include>
```bash
npm run dev
```
</div>

This will start your asset watcher, which listens for any changes made to your codebase. When a change is detected, it refreshes the current page and dynamically injects the necessary Tailwind CSS classes.

## Building Assets for Production

When you are ready to build your assets and push your code to production you will want to run:

<include src="docs/filename-top.html"></include><include src="docs/file-buttons.html" file="none"></include>
```bash
npm run build
```
</div>

This will compile and minify all your assets, resulting in a faster application and an improved experience.

## Optimizing Laravel for Production

When you are ready to deploy your application to production, you should optimize your Laravel application on your production server. You can do this by running:

<include src="docs/filename-top.html"></include><include src="docs/file-buttons.html" file="none"></include>
```bash
php artisan optimize
```
</div>

This command will optimize your application by caching the configuration and routes, and pre-compiling your views. This will result in a faster application and improved performance.

You can also optimize Filament by running:

<include src="docs/filename-top.html"></include><include src="docs/file-buttons.html" file="none"></include>
```bash
php artisan filament:optimize
```
</div>

This will cache the Filament components and Blade icons.

## Themes

Wave supports **Themes**, allowing you to change the appearance of your application simply by switching themes. When you start your asset watcher or build your assets, it will automatically handle the assets for the currently active theme. We'll explore this further in the themes section.
